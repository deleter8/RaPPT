#Ideas

Personal experiment of making raw design ideas public rather than putting this on a private google doc somewhere.

##Current design notes

* Chomps earned when geist collides with pig at rate of 1:1
* Chomps buy Bacon at a fluctuating rate. 
* Bacon buys a game as a pig at a rate of 1:1. 
* Players can pay $ one-time to disable ads. 
* Players can buy $ aesthetic items for their characters
  * Players might be able to use some number of chomps in place of real $
* Players can buy $ nods/frowns at any time. 
  * Initial thought, $1 = 5 nods / 5 frowns (or let them specify custom ratio adding up to 10, or maybe they just have a balance and they can use it for either)
  * On every page of the site there is nod/frown button (in-game there are also hotkeys)
  * Players give me a nod when something makes them happy or they like it for some reason
  * Players frown at me when something disappoints, angers, or otherwise makes them unhappy
  * Nods/frowns are saved along with the context of when it was given
  * Nods/frowns act as both a tip jar and a way to give meaningful feedback ($ attaches worth)
  * Players accumulate nods/frowns at a rate of 1/day for every day where they are logged in for at least 10 minutes (initial value)
* Players unlock items and new characters for the two roles
* Bots & bot zoo keep economy & game flowing smoothly
* Seed initial game with some bacon & chomps
